# Python Project 

## Background

This project was made up of two parts: 1) PyBank and 2) PyPoll.

Python and Visual Studio Code were used in this project.

## PyBank

* In this portion of the project, we were tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictitious company. We were provided with a set of financial/budget data.  

* The python script created analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

An example output is as follows:

  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)


* The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this portion of the project, we were taksed with modernizing the vote counting process of a small rural town. 

* We were given a set of poll data composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. A python script was then created that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* An example of the output is as follows:

  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Khan
  -------------------------


* The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
